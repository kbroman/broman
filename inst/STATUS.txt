----------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 0.46, 3/13/2014:

  Add function make() for running make within a package directory, for
  use with devtools().


Version 0.45, 3/9/2014:

  Add function brocolors() returning vectors of colors I use in
  figures.

  Convert package to use roxygen2 for documentation.


Version 0.44, 10/29/2013:

   Revise tripoints() and related functions to invisibly return the
   (x,y) coordinates of the points, as plotted.


Version 0.43, 8/2/2013:

   Added qqline2(), which is like qqline() but for two datasets.


Version 0.42, 6/8/2013:

   Revise grayplot for better treatment of x- and y-axis titles,
   including the use of mgp/mgp.x/mgp.y.


Version 0.41, 5/13/2013:

   Added function histlines for making a histogram with lines().


Version 0.40, 5/3/2013:

   Added function xlimlabel for determining appropriate xlim to add
   character string labels to a plot

   Added functions strwidth2xlim and strwidth2lines for calculating
   margin lengths or x-axis limits that will fit a given set of text.


Version 0.39, 10/17/2012:

   In Description file, added "Depends: R (>= 2.15.0)", since get0
   uses paste0.  I could use paste(..., sep=""), but...


Version 0.38, 10/4/2012:

    Changed order of plotting of vertical and horizontal lines in
    grayplot().  Also added ability to control the margin parameters
    (spacing of axis labels and such).


Version 0.37, 7/19/2012:

    Improved convert2hex so it handles numbers > 255; added alias
    dec2hex.  Added related function hex2dec.
  

Version 0.36, 5/14/2012:

    Added function cf() for comparing vectors/matrices/lists,
    including proper handling of NAs

    Added functions get0() and get.() which combine get and paste.

    Added grayplot() for plots with gray backgrounds.

    Added manyboxplot() for making boxplot-like figures with *many* groups

    Added paste.() function, which is just paste(..., sep=".")

    Added function revrainbow(), which is just rev(rainbow(start=0, end=2/3, ...))

    Added paste00(), paste..(), paste0.() and paste.0()


Version 0.35, 4/11/2012:

    runningmean() can now also calculate a running SD.

    Revised bromanversion() to use packageVersion().

    Simplified myround(), using sprintf().


Version 0.34, 11/7/2011:

    Added NAMESPACE (for R 2.14.0)


Version 0.33, 4/23/2011:

    Revised normalize() to handle NAs.

    Added function winsorize() for winsorizing a numeric vector.

    Added function bromanversion() to print installed version number. 


Version 0.32, 12/14/2010:

    Added function objectsizes(), for calculating the sizes of the
    objects in one's workspace.


Version 0.31, 11/22/2010:

    Added functions triplot(), tripoints(), trilines(), triarrow() for
    plotting Holmans triangle (an equilateral triangle used to depict
    trinomial distributions).

    Added function venn() for drawing a to-scale Venn diagram.

    Added function arrowlocator() for using locator() to indicate the
    endpoints of an arrow and then draw it.


Version 0.30, 11/17/2010:

    Fixed a bug in permtest (the pval argument didn't work).


Version 0.29, 8/6/2010:

    Deleted the nqrank() function, as I've now placed it within
    R/qtl. 


Version 0.28, 3/25/2010:

    Slight change to nqrank, so that -Inf values are replaced by
    10 *less* than the minimum of any finite values (rather than 10
    *more* than that minimum).


Version 0.27, 11/6/2009:

    Revised runningmean and runningratio so that the statistics can be
    calculated at arbitrary locations.  Also revised them so that the
    input do not need to have sorted positions.


Version 0.26, 10/26/2009:

    Slight change to nqrank, to preserve the mean and SD.

    Fixed a few links in the help files.

    Revised h() to conform to a change in R.

Version 0.25, 8/11/2009:

    Slight change to nqrank, so that ties are not jittered by default,
    but may be (if one uses the argument jitter=TRUE).

Version 0.24, 4/28/2009:

    Updated license to GPL-3

Version 0.23, 11/20/2008:

    Revised perm.test and paired.perm.test so that they can return the
    actual permutation results (rather than just the p-value), though
    the default is still to just return the p-value.

    Fixed a bug in myround().

Version 0.22, 9/19/2008:

    Revised attachfile and attachwork so that they return (invisibly)
    TRUE/FALSE according to whether the file was found.

    Also added an argument 'verbose'; if TRUE and the file can't be
    loaded, a warning is given.

Version 0.21, 2/29/2008:

    Added a function normalize() for doing quantile normalization.

Version 0.20, 1/18/2007:

    Modified fisher() so that the p-value is Prop'n >= rather
    than just >.

    Added a similar function, chisq() for doing a chi-square test
    with p-value calculated by simulation.  In 0.20-2, suppressed
    warnings produced by chisq.test.


Version 0.19, 10/9/2007:

    Added a function runningratio, for calculating
    sum(numerator)/sum(denominator) in sliding window.

    Fixed some errors in the help files.


Version 0.18, 9/20/2007:

    Fixed a bug in loadwork().


Version 0.17, 1/16/2006:
  
    Added a function h() for getting access to html help files while
    running R via ESS within emacs.


Version 0.16, 12/19/2006:

    Added a function runningmean().

    Fixed a bug in paired.perm.test().


Version 0.15, 8/14/2006

    Added a function myround().
	

Version 0.14, 6/28/2006

    Added a function mypairs(), similar to pairs() but producing only
    the upper triangle.

    Added a convert2hex() function.


Version 0.13, 12/8/2004

    Added attachfile() and loadfile(), similar to loadwork() and
    attachwork(). 

Version 0.12, 8/6/2004

    Added little utility functions loadwork() and attachwork()
    for loading or attaching .RData files of the form
    "dir*/.RData", when * is an integer, and especially when
    dir = "Work".

Version 0.11, 4/29/2002:

    Added perm.test and paired.perm.test for getting p-values for a
    two-sample t-statistic by permutation.

    There was an obvious bug in the function fisher(), which is now
    fixed. 


Version 0.10, 11/21/2001:

    This is a package to contain miscellaneous R functions that I find
    useful.  

    Currently, it contains functions to get SEs of sample quantiles, 
    a sampling version of fisher.test, a re-parse of the output of
    qr(), simulation from a multivariate normal distribution, and
    numerical integration by Simpson's rule.
