----------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 0.27, 11/6/2009:

    Revised runningmean and runningratio so that the statistics can be
    calculated at arbitrary locations.  Also revised them so that the
    input do not need to have sorted positions.


Version 0.26, 10/26/2009:

    Slight change to nqrank, to preserve the mean and SD.

    Fixed a few links in the help files.

    Revised h() to conform to a change in R.

Version 0.25, 8/11/2009:

    Slight change to nqrank, so that ties are not jittered by default,
    but may be (if one uses the argument jitter=TRUE).

Version 0.24, 4/28/2009:

    Updated license to GPL-3

Version 0.23, 11/20/2008:

    Revised perm.test and paired.perm.test so that they can return the
    actual permutation results (rather than just the p-value), though
    the default is still to just return the p-value.

    Fixed a bug in myround().

Version 0.22, 9/19/2008:

    Revised attachfile and attachwork so that they return (invisibly)
    TRUE/FALSE according to whether the file was found.

    Also added an argument 'verbose'; if TRUE and the file can't be
    loaded, a warning is given.

Version 0.21, 2/29/2008:

    Added a function normalize() for doing quantile normalization.

Version 0.20, 1/18/2007:

    Modified fisher() so that the p-value is Prop'n >= rather
    than just >.

    Added a similar function, chisq() for doing a chi-square test
    with p-value calculated by simulation.  In 0.20-2, suppressed
    warnings produced by chisq.test.


Version 0.19, 10/9/2007:

    Added a function runningratio, for calculating
    sum(numerator)/sum(denominator) in sliding window.

    Fixed some errors in the help files.


Version 0.18, 9/20/2007:

    Fixed a bug in loadwork().


Version 0.17, 1/16/2006:
  
    Added a function h() for getting access to html help files while
    running R via ESS within emacs.


Version 0.16, 12/19/2006:

    Added a function runningmean().

    Fixed a bug in paired.perm.test().


Version 0.15, 8/14/2006

    Added a function myround().
	

Version 0.14, 6/28/2006

    Added a function mypairs(), similar to pairs() but producing only
    the upper triangle.

    Added a convert2hex() function.


Version 0.13, 12/8/2004

    Added attachfile() and loadfile(), similar to loadwork() and
    attachwork(). 

Version 0.12, 8/6/2004

    Added little utility functions loadwork() and attachwork()
    for loading or attaching .RData files of the form
    "dir*/.RData", when * is an integer, and especially when
    dir = "Work".

Version 0.11, 4/29/2002:

    Added perm.test and paired.perm.test for getting p-values for a
    two-sample t-statistic by permutation.

    There was an obvious bug in the function fisher(), which is now
    fixed. 


Version 0.10, 11/21/2001:

    This is a package to contain miscellaneous R functions that I find
    useful.  

    Currently, it contains functions to get SEs of sample quantiles, 
    a sampling version of fisher.test, a re-parse of the output of
    qr(), simulation from a multivariate normal distribution, and
    numerical integration by Simpson's rule.
